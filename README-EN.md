## About the Project

MatrixSolver is a Python project that uses the powerful **manim** library to visualize the solution of systems of linear equations in matrix form. This project was created by **Maxim Antonov**. Scientific Supervisor: **Yuri Alexandrovich Labazov**.

### Project Features

1. Visualization of the process of solving systems of linear equations.
2. Solving systems that may have multiple solutions or no solutions at all.
